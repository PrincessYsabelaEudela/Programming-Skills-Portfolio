Exercise 2: Glossary

Think of five programming words youâ€™ve learned about in the previous chapters. 
Use these words as the keys in your glossary, and store their meanings as values.
Print each word and its meaning as neatly formatted output. 
You might print the word followed by a colon and then its meaning, or print the word on one line and then print its meaning indented on a second line. 
Use the newline character (\n) to insert a blank line between each word-meaning pair in your output.

            'List': 'It stores multiple data or items in a single variable'}
