Exercise 4: Guest List

If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? 

Make a list that includes at least three people youâ€™d like to invite to dinner. 

Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.
"""

dinner = ["Kim Taehyung", "Hoshimachi Suisei", "Taylor Swift"]
for i in dinner: #for loop iterates over the list one by one with the message
    print ("Hello", i + ", I am inviting you for a dinner this Saturday")
